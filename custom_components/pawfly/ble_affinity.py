"""Preferred-proxy affinity for Home Assistant Bluetooth connections.

Vendored verbatim into each nateshome BLE integration (ac_infinity, bedjet,
fluvalble, ecoflow_iot). Change it here first
(`/data/home/tmp/ble_affinity.py` is the source of truth) and copy to every
integration in the same pass.

Why this exists
---------------
`HaBleakClientWrapper.connect()` (habluetooth `wrappers.py`) ignores the
`BLEDevice` an integration hands it and re-picks the connection path on
every connect: sorted by advertisement RSSI, then
`BaseHaScanner._score_connection_paths` (penalties for connections in
progress, prior failures and a last free slot). An integration therefore
has NO supported way to say "connect through the proxy in this room";
habluetooth #602 asks for one and is still open.

The distance the RSSI sort ignores is what matters here. Every ghost link
seen on this network (2026-09-09 .. 2026-09-17) formed on a marginal link
to a *distant* proxy: the disconnect handshake failed to complete over the
weak path and left the peripheral holding a connection the proxy had
forgotten. A device that is always carried by the proxy sitting next to it
does not get into that state.

How
---
`make_affinity_client_class(base, ...)` returns a subclass of whatever
client class `bleak_retry_connector.establish_connection` would otherwise
use and overrides ONE method, `_async_get_best_available_backend_and_device`.
When the preferred scanner currently advertises the address, can accept a
connection, and has not failed this address `max_failures` times in a row,
it is chosen; in every other case the default selection runs unchanged.
All of the wrapper's bookkeeping (`_add_connecting`, `_track`, slot
release, abort-on-unregister) still runs because `connect()` is untouched.

Fallback is therefore bounded by habluetooth's own failure counter, which
resets on the next successful connect through that scanner:
`establish_connection` retries, the first `max_failures` attempts go to the
preferred proxy, then the default path takes over for the rest.

The preferred scanner is named by its ESPHome node name (`scanner.adapter`,
what `bleak_esphome` registers from `device_info.name`), the same identity
the integrations already store in `last_holding_proxy`. Source MAC and the
full `scanner.name` are accepted too.

Private-API note: the overridden method and `_async_get_backend_for_ble_device`
are habluetooth internals (present in 6.26.x). `affinity_supported()` checks
for them; when absent the factory returns `base` unchanged and logs once, so
an upgrade degrades to default routing rather than breaking connections.
